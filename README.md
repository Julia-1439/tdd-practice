Exercises in practicing Test-Driven Development. Utilizes the Jest library.

major concepts utilized:

- test-driven development is a disciplined way of coding that allows one to more easily and efficiently write complex programs while maintaining correctness. it makes validating new changes much easier, ensures as many cases are accounted for, promotes modularityy, and self-documents how the program should behave. 
- a developer defines how a program should <em>specifically</em> behave via tests before writing code.
